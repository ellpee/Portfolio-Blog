You can think your job is exciting or fun, but you may not be happy. My meaning of happiness is having life meaning or life fulfillment. You find life meaning or fulfillment through the experiences you engage in. According to the human lifespan, we have approximately 28,000 days (75 years) on this earth and 11,000 (30 years) of those days are spent working. Each of those days come with its share of experiences, and we must experience wisely.</p>\\n<p>While on the job, I felt as though my experiences were not meaningful. My level of happiness outweighed that drive I once had. I felt like my experiences were more harmful than good. My current position failed to push me toward the path of success I’ve envisioned (We all have our definition of success). It is your experiences that matter most to your happiness at work and in life. Feeling as though you’re just another stop on an assembly line isn’t a great feeling to have at a company you once loved. Life is too short to spend at a job that doesn’t make you smile, challenge your intellect, or offer opportunities for both personal or professional growth.</p>\\n<h2>Work environment = Physical Environment + Work Relationships</h2>\\n<p>Experiences are not the only piece to this happiness formula. Having meaningful relationships play a huge role in shaping that environment I mentioned early. Disengaged unhappy leaders or employees aren’t any fun to work with. Their emotions and mindset impact everyone else’s mood and performance tremendously. Science shows clear neurological links between feelings, thoughts, and actions. When we are in the grips of strong negative emotions, it’s like having blinders on. We focus mostly–sometimes only–on the source of the pain. We don’t consider the racist or discriminating comments we let “slip” out of our mouths or the negativity we spread. We don’t think about the gossip we spend hours talking about that may or may not get back to the person we’re mentioning. We don’t think about anything but ourselves in those moments. These are ingredients of a toxic environment. As someone new to the tech field, I believe that I needed more from the work experiences I’m involved in. It was time to create an exit plan.
